# Library Overview
## Question 1: What is the selected library 
I selected the JavaScript library Chart.js.
## Question 2: What does the library do
The function of the library is a highly configurable plugin used to create graphs and charts using JavaScript and HTML. The purpose of Chart.js is to provide programmers using the JS the ability to plot and present data with built in graphs and charts[1]. To use the library you must add a link to the Content Delivery Network and create a canvas where you would like the chart[1]. This snippet from my code shows how I did it:\

The library not only just displays basic diagrams but the configuration of them is a significant part of the general idea. You can customize anything from the font, background and chart colors all the way to what type of chart and any community plugins you would like[3]. There are so many configuration aspects of this library, some more things you can do are add animations and transitions to add life and character to your source code[4]. The last thing to mention are one of the if not the most vital point of the whole graph other then the actual data are the axes. Of course, depending on the graph the number of axes will change. For example, the cartesian chart has at least one x-axis and at least one y-axis where as a polar area chart like used in my sample code only have one axis[5].

## Question 3: Functionalities
The functionality of this library is very user friendly and so you can either create your data in a constant variable with your data, get it from input like how I explained previously but also can create it in the constructor of the graph itself. In my sample I created an array above but I could have easily had that array in the data function too:\

Another function of the graph is the ability to call the array to make labels but you can also make a legend. If you see how it is initliazed above in the data function as well as how the the array is created the label function of this libraries output looks like this with the corresponding colors too:\

## Question 4: When was it created?
Chart.js was created in 2013 and is under an MIT license, the library is maintained by the community and attempts to stay conistent with minor changes coming bi-monthly and bigger changes happen every couple years or so[2].
## Question 5: Why did I choose this?
The reason I chose this firstly was I really enjoy coding in JavaScript even more then in Python believe it or not. So, I wanted to continue learning and developing my skills in JS. Secondly I found a lot of my classmates were choosing Python and I wanted to do something different then the rest, Connor confirmed that when he let me know I am one of very few not doing Python. The other part that intrigued me about this was gaining familiarity with HTML. I worked with it a bit this summer at NB Power but any chance I get to improve I take as A lot of Co-op jobs look for experience with it.
## Question 6: Library influence of learning
Overall, as I continued to work through different problems I began to realize it wasnt complex just intricate. The code is not confusing you just need to be precise. It helped me think about JS in a different sense as before in the programming questions I had my Java brain on and as well as for the labs but for this it made me think back to my experience this summer with the weird hybrid JS HTML programming. I learned a lot about running things that do not just print in the terminal but actually extend out of the text editor.
## Question 7: Overall experience
To be completely honest I was expecting a very hard complex piece of code but this was more user friendly then expected; it is very possible I only thought so because of my previous experience. I recommend this library to a CS or SWE student who needs to create a graph or bar chart becuase I think the webpage format was very easy to use and could possibly be extremely useful. I have a couple of companions in Kin and science that I would not recommend this to as you need a background in coding. Personally, I am debating using this in my 2043 assignments as they require data to be converted into charts/graphs and I do not totally enjoy using excel I think this library could be useful in this case.
